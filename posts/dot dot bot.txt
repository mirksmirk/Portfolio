Brief
- Completed as a "Lighthouse project" - a project driven by individual interest rather than customer demand

- Completed with a team; I joined mid-way to drive completion and lead UX design and strategy

Challenge 1: Refining our value proposition

When I joined this project, the 3-person team had been working for several months becoming experts in the landscape of chatbot design and development. However, in the process, they had lost the ability to speak from an objective perspective. I stepped in to help them articulate their expertise and choose a direction of maximum value.

 Challenge 2: Developing a unique, universal method for chatbot design
 
 Taking cues from Google sprint, IDEO methods, and our own SAP tools Mosaic, we set out to design a solution for teams with or without design expertise. We envisioned a method that is versatile, step-by-step, and easy to execute. With that in mind, we built upon our design-led development process to meet the unique challenges of natural language processing.
